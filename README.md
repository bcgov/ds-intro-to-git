# Introduction To Version Control With Git and GitHub

This is a repository to house materials for a 1/2 day workshop introducing participants to version control using [git](https://git-scm.com) and the popular code hosting platform, [GitHub](https://github.com).

The goal of this workshop is to teach data professionals how to harness the power of version control by giving attendees a foundation in the fundamentals of version control with [git](https://git-scm.com).

GitHub is a widely-used platform for hosting and sharing code repositories, facilitating seamless collaboration among developers. Git, on the other hand, is a popular version control system that enables you to track changes in your code, collaborate with team members, and maintain a history of your project's development.

By the end of this course, you will have gained a fundamental understanding of version control, enabling you to:

-   Set up a GitHub account and install the software git (pre-workshop)
-   Understand the value-add of using version control to manage software and code-based data science projects
-   Understand the basics of how automated version control systems work
-   Use git, popular command-line version control software, to track local file changes
-   What are remote hosting platforms and why do we use them?
-   Connect to GitHub, create a remote repository and push local changes to GitHub
-   Be familiar with the [public BC Gov GitHub organization](https://github.com/bcgov) which has guidelines and requirements for hosting government-developed open source repositories

The workshop content will follow best practices for version control such as writing descriptive commit messages, including a .gitignore file and tracking relevant project files.

## Who should take this course?

-   Anyone looking to solidify their understanding of version control
-   Anyone keen to learn what git or GitHub is (**no prior experience necessary!**)
-   Anyone wondering how version control can be used to manage and collaborate on software and code-based data science projects

### Pre-Course Work

**Important!**

Before the course starts, we ask that all attendees install git and GitBash and have a basic text editor such as Wordpad, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text. Instructions for how to install these tools are found in [Installation Instructions and Set-Up](https://bcgov.github.io/ds-intro-to-git/pre-workshop/software-install.html). If anyone is having troubles getting the software up and running, please contact us **before** the course starts so that we can hit the ground running during the workshop.

::: notes
As part of today’s workshop, we’ll be coding in real time, working through concepts together on the fly. This approach lets us explore the process interactively. While this can be dynamic and fun, it also means there may be moments where we need to debug or adjust as we go. 

Since we’ll be coding in real time, it’s important that everyone feels comfortable and engaged. To keep things running smoothly in our virtual setting, let’s go over a few best practices:

If you have questions, please feel free to drop them in the chat or use the ‘raise hand’ feature—we’ll address them as we go.  Your engagement and questions will make this experience even more valuable, so don’t hesitate to share your thoughts along the way!
Keep your microphones on mute unless speaking to minimize background noise. 
And if we get disconnected, don’t worry! You can rejoin using the same meeting link, and Lindsay will let you back in.
Cameras on for the first bit so the faciliators get to know who you are and can put a face to a name.  

These simple steps will help ensure we all get the most out of today’s session, so let’s dive in!

The link to the course materials was sent with the pre-workshop assignment and installation instructions.  For your convenience the link is at the bottom of the slide.

::: notes

Before we begin, I’d like to take a moment to outline our workshop code of conduct. These guidelines are in place to ensure this session remains a positive and productive space for everyone:

First and foremost, we aim to create a welcoming and supportive environment for all participants, regardless of background.
We encourage respectful discussion and questions throughout the session. Healthy dialogue enriches the learning experience, but it’s important to maintain a tone of mutual respect as teaching and learning in a virtual environment can be hard.
Finally, we ask that you be fully present and engaged during the workshop. Multitasking can wait—this is your opportunity to focus and get the most out of our time together.

By following these principles, we can create a space where everyone feels comfortable and valued. Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

:::

::: notes
Before diving into today’s workshop, let’s quickly review the foundational steps you’ve already completed in preparation

Installed Git (including Git Bash): You’ve downloaded and installed Git from git-scm.com. This included Git Bash, a terminal that allows you to interact with Git through command-line commands.

Configured Git: You configured Git by setting up your username and email address, which ensures that every change you commit is associated with your identity. If you need a refresher, the configuration steps can be found here.

Created a GitHub Account: You set up a GitHub account, which will allow you to store and collaborate on code projects in a cloud-based repository. As part of this process you enabled Two-Factor Authentication (2MFA) to enhance account security. You also created a Personal Access Token to allow Git to authenticate securely with your GitHub account for operations like pushing or pulling code.

These steps provided the groundwork for today’s workshop, ensuring you have the tools and configurations necessary to follow along effectively. If you encounter any challenges related to these steps, feel free to drop a question into the chat for assistance.

You will also have configured your email and user name so that git can connect to GitHub. Most of you did this in Git Bash terminal.

Question for Bonnie: do we want to check configuration at some point?

Not this.  But we’ve all been in this situation before: it seems unnecessary to have multiple nearly-identical versions of the same document – either by yourself or spread around among colleagues. It’s difficult to tell the difference between files, and what was changed when, by whom, and why?

Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that are used to help teams manage changes to code/documents over time.

Consider the following scenario. You and your colleagues have been asked to do an analysis of the Work Environment Survey study to determine if workplace satisfaction has increased or decreased significantly since the start of the pandemic. You and your colleagues want to be able to work on the project at the same time, but have run into problems doing this in the past. If you take turns, each of you will spend a lot of time waiting for the other to finish, but if you work on your own copies and save them to the local network, things will be lost, overwritten, or duplicated. A colleague suggests using version control to manage your work.

![](/figures/section-2-git/sequential.png){fig-pos="H"}

::: notes
Git keeps track of snapshots in time – each document or file starts with a base version and then you tell git to save just the changes you made at each step of the way.

You decide which changes make up the each snapshot, and git stores those changes and keeps useful metadata about them.

You can think of it as a recording of your progress: you can rewind to start at the base document and play back each change you made, eventually arriving at your more recent version.

Each snapshot is called a ‘commit’.

the changes they want to keep can be merged back into the original. If they don't like the result, the changes can be discarded.

Unless multiple users make changes to the same section of the document (a conflict) you can incorporate two sets of changes into the same base document.

Documents/Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers facilitating collaboration among different people.

*A repository is a data structure that stores **metadata** for a set of files or directory structure, as well as a **historical record of changes** to the to repository.*

::: notes
In version control systems, a repository is a data structure that stores metadata for a set of files or directory structure, as well as a historical record of changes to the to repository.

You store all of your project files in a folder.

All of the files, plus the complete history for all the files in a that folder make up a repository (repo).

::: notes

This slide illustrates the structure of a typical Git repository. Let me walk you through its key components:

At the top level, we have the wes-analysis folder, which is the root directory of this repository. This is where all our files and folders for the project are organized.Inside this folder you likely have other project-realted folders such **doc**, which contains documentation files such as a list of acronyms or reports.  **ref** holds reference materials and could store articles and images for visual documentation or presentations. **plots** is where visual outputs like graphs or charts from the analysis are saved. **code** houses the scripts or programming files you're working on, forming the core of the project’s logic.

**data** contains the raw data files in this hypothetical project.  It’s worth noting that sensitive or private data, like these CSV files, won’t become public as we will give explicit instructions to git to ignore them.

Two important files help manage this repository

The **.git** *directory* is hidden by default and is what makes this a Git repository. It tracks changes to files, allowing us to manage versions of our code and content.

The **.gitignore** *file* lists files or patterns we don’t want Git to track—like large data files such as the CSVs. This is a common practice to keep repositories clean and focused on the essential project elements.

Together, this structure keeps our work organized and ensures that the repository is ready for version control and collaboration.

::: notes

Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in files, particularly source code. 

Git helps manage versions of your work, making it easy to revert to earlier states or identify when and why changes were made.

It enables multiple people to collaborate on projects while maintaining a detailed history of all changes.  It enables contributors to work simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work.

Git supports parallel development, allowing teams to work on different features or fixes without interference.  This is done through Branching and Merging which we will review shortly.

Distributed Model: Every user has a full copy of the repository, meaning most operations require only local files and resources.  (This makes Git extremely fast and reliable).

Unlike many version control systems that treat data as a list of file changes over time, Git thinks of data as a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. Every time you commit, Git essentially takes a snapshot of your project’s state and stores a reference to it.

Reliability and Integrity:

It’s impossible to change files or directories without Git detecting it. This ensures you don’t lose information in transit or encounter undetected file corruption.

Once a snapshot is committed to Git, it’s incredibly hard to lose, especially if you regularly push your changes to a remote repository.

::: notes
Stage/Add Usage: `git add [file/directory]` 
Purpose: Allows you to select which changes will be committed.  
Definition: Moves changes (new files, modifications, or deletions) in your working directory to the staging area, preparing them to be included in the next commit. 

Commit Usage: `git commit m "message"` 
Purpose: Saves a version of your work, making it easier to track and revert to if necessary. 
Definition: Records the changes in the staging area to the repository's history as a new snapshot. Each commit includes a unique ID and a descriptive message to explain the changes. 

Push Usage: `git push [remote] [branch]` 
Purpose: Synchronizes your work with the remote repository. 
Definition: Uploads your local commits to a remote repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) so others can access them. 

Pull Usage: `git pull [remote] [branch]` 
Purpose: Ensures your local repository is up-to-date with the remote one.
Definition: Fetches changes from a remote repository and integrates them into your local branch. This is a combination of git fetch (retrieve changes) and git merge (apply changes). 

Clone Usage: `git clone [repositoryurl]`  
Purpose: Allows you to work on a project locally by copying it from a remote source like GitHub.
Definition: Creates a copy of an existing remote repository on your local machine, including all files, branches, and commit history.

Branch Usage: `git branch [branchname]` (to create a branch)\
`git checkout [branchname]` (to switch to a branch)\
`git switch [branchname]` (alternative to `checkout`) 
Purpose: Facilitates parallel development and experimentation while keeping the main codebase stable.
Definition: Represents an independent line of development within a repository. Branches allow you to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main project until changes are ready to be merged. 

Fork Command: No direct Git command; done via hosting services like GitHub. Definition: Creates a personal copy of someone else's repository in your own GitHub (or similar service) account. This is independent of the original repository, allowing you to make changes without affecting the source project. Purpose: Enables you to contribute to opensource projects or customize a repository for your own use while keeping the original repository intact. Contributions can be shared back via **pull requests**.

## Review: Bash Jargon {background-image="/figures/section-2-git/git-logo.png" background-size="10%" background-position="85% 6%"}

``` {bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "1|2|3|4|5|"

$ cd path/to/directory          # Go to specified directory - "quotes" are needed if there are spaces 
$ cd ..                         # Go up one directory level
$ mkdir new_directory           # Create specified directory
$ ls                            # List directories and files
$ ls -a                         # List directories and files, including hidden
```

::: notes
Let’s review some common Bash commands that you’ll use frequently when working with Git and navigating your file system.  

**cd path/to/directory**
   - This command lets you navigate to a specific directory. Think of it as ‘changing your location’ in the file system.  
   - If the directory path includes spaces, make sure to enclose it in quotes, like `cd "My Folder"`.  

**`cd ..`**  
   - The `..` represents the parent directory. Using this command moves you up one level in the directory hierarchy. For example, if you’re in a folder called `projects`, `cd ..` will take you back to its parent folder.  

**`mkdir new_directory`**  
   - This creates a new directory with the specified name. It’s a quick way to organize your files into new folders directly from the command line.  

**`ls`**  
   - This lists the contents of the current directory, showing all files and subdirectories. It’s a handy way to see where you are and what’s in your folder.  

**`ls -a`**  
   - Adding the `-a` flag shows all files, including hidden ones. Hidden files usually start with a dot (`.`), like `.git`, and they’re essential for tasks like managing Git repositories.  

These commands form the foundation of navigating and organizing your files in the terminal, which is key to working effectively with Git."

$ git add <filename>                # add a new file/change to the staging area

$ git restore                       # restore file/s to previous commit
```

::: notes
"Now, let’s review some essential Git commands you’ll use when working with repositories.  

**`git init`**  
- This command initializes a Git repository in the current directory. It creates a hidden `.git` folder, which Git uses to track changes to your files. You only need to do this once per project to start version control.  

**`git status`**  
- Running this command gives you a snapshot of your repository’s current state. It will show any changes to files, whether they’ve been staged for commit, and if there are untracked files. It’s like your ‘to-do list’ for what’s happening in Git.  

**`git add <filename>`**  
- This stages a file or changes to a file, adding it to the next commit. Replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you want to add. If you want to stage all changes at once, you can use `git add .`. 
   
   **`git commit -m "commit message"`**  
- This command takes all the changes in the staging area and commits them to your repository, creating a new snapshot. The `-m` flag allows you to add a message describing the changes, which is critical for understanding your history later.  

**`git log`** 
- Use this command to view the commit history of your repository. It shows who made the changes, when they were made, and the commit messages. It’s an excellent way to review the progress of your project.  

**`git diff`**  
- This displays the changes between commits or the differences between your working directory and the last commit. It’s useful for checking exactly what has changed before committing.  
   
**`git restore`**  
- This restores files to a previous commit, effectively undoing changes. It’s handy if you want to discard changes or return a file to a specific version.  

These commands form the backbone of working with Git. As you use them, you’ll develop a deeper understanding of how Git tracks and manages your work."

::: notes
To this point, we have learned a lot of different git commands and workflows involved in tracking all of our changes, keeping our repositories up-to-date, and collaborating across computers using GitHub. While there are multiple levels of nuance that go into each of these steps, let's lay out a typical workflow.

Ignore data files! .gitignore

What if we have files that we do not want Git to track for us, like backup files created by our editor or intermediate files created during data analysis? This often is the case in BC Government data projects.

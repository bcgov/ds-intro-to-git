## Why Version Control?

BC Stats has A LOT of source code that make:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   aggregate / “tidy” data tables
-   figures/plots & maps
-   PDF reports
-   dashboards & applications
-   prediction models
-   provincial statistics

::: notes
BC Stats has a lot of source code that make both final products and intermediate artifacts such clean tables of data. And the multitude of verisons and copies of scripts that we handle in a project can start to get overwhelming and messy.  We can loose track of a change we made, or seek out creative ways to keep from losing track of our work as we share files around.

::: notes
A version control system is a tool that keeps track of changes for us. There are several options; we are going to talk about git. It keeps track of snapshots in time.

You decide which changes make up each sna+shot, and git stores those changes and keeps useful metadata about them. You store all of your project files in a folder. All of the files, plus the complete history for all the files in a that folder make up a repository (“repo”). Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers facilitating collaboration among different people.

From Git website: Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.
